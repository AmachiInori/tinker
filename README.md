Added CT,CP,CF scalings for free energy simulations.

# What is this branch? 
AMOEBA+ potential without charge flux implementation is fully supported in the main [Tinker release](https://github.com/TinkerTools/Tinker/tree/release).

This branch includes the preliminary implementation of charge flux into AMOEBA+ model.

We are currently merging charge flux implementation into the latest release.

Date: 11/22/2019

AMOEBA+ model was implemented based on the Tinker 8.2. Here are new features comparing to AMOEBA:

## vdW term
  A new combining rule (W-H) for epsilon was added. 

## charge transfer (CT) term 
  A non-bonded interaction with user defined exclusion rules (1-2, 1-3, etc). 
  This is implemented as an individual energy term in the same manner as AMOEBA vdW term. 

## polarization
  AMOEBA+ uses a new damping scheme for the direct induction, while keeps the Thole damping for the mutual part.

## charge penetration (CP)
  We use slightly different damping functions than HIPPO model.

## charge flux (CF) 

	Note: Supported only in this branch (AMOEBA+CF), not in AMOEBA+

  First I looped over bond and angle to accumulate charge fluxes. Then I added the accumulated charges to the force field defined charges to get the updated charges.
  Potential is accumulated on the fly in the calculation of electrostatic and polarization energy.
	A chain rule term due to charge flux is calculated finally. 

## ind&inp induced dipole
  Currently in AMOEBA we have two sets of induced dipoles. In AMOEBA+ CPU code, I have merged them and use only one set of dipole. We used two sets of scaling factors (polar-1x-intra and polar-1x-inter).

	Note: this is also supported in the latest Tinker.
