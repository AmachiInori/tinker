                    Building the Tinker Package Using CMake
                    #######################################

      The Tinker package can be built using the CMake compilation utility.
      CMake works on Linux, MacOS and Windows. It requires the pkg-config
      and cmake-data packages, in addition to cmake.

      cmake is a command-line utility, and can be replaced in step 4 by
      ccmake for a text-based UI or cmake-gui for a graphical frontend.

      Note that before building Tinker, the FFTW libraries must be built or
      installed. These libraries can be built following the instructions in
      the file /fftw/0README. Alternatively, the libraries can be installed
      on Ubuntu Linux or similar by using the command "sudo apt-get install
      libfftw3-dev".

      To build Tinker with cmake, issue the following commands:

               (1) cd Tinker  [i.e., the top-level directory]
               (2) cp cmake/CMakeLists.txt ./source
               (3) mkdir build && cd build
               (4) cmake ../source
               (5) make -j4
               (6) make install
